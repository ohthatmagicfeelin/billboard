How this is going to work

- it is like a radio, it plays a song randomly but weights towards the top of the charts.
- additionally, (paid feature?) the could be a game element where you can listen to a year, decade or all time and have to guess the track when it plays. leader board and stuff for people who guess well.
- 31k tracks and 11k artists, will need to search spotify as a track comes up. Fill in db with spotify ids as users play tracks.
